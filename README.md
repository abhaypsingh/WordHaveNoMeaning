# Words Without Meaning

## Project Overview
"Words Without Meaning" is an educational game that demonstrates how words have no inherent meaning without context. The game challenges users' assumptions about language by presenting words with multiple potential meanings, then revealing how context dramatically changes interpretation.

## Educational Objectives
1. Demonstrate that words are arbitrary symbols whose meanings are determined by context
2. Illustrate how the same word can have contradictory meanings in different contexts
3. Encourage critical thinking about language and communication
4. Provide an engaging, interactive experience that makes linguistic concepts accessible

## Core Game Mechanics
1. Present users with words without contextual information
2. Offer multiple potential meanings for each word
3. Have users select what they believe is the correct meaning
4. Show a contradictory sentence that uses the word differently
5. Provide educational messaging about linguistic concepts
6. Track progress and provide feedback on learning

## Development Approach

The implementation of this project is recommended to follow a phased approach:

### Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 weeks)
- Basic application structure and navigation
- Word database schema and initial data (50-100 words)
- Core game logic implementation
- Simple UI with basic styling
- Local storage for settings and game state

### Phase 2: Enhanced Gameplay (3-4 weeks)
- Complete word database (all 500 words)
- Enhanced UI with animations and transitions
- Sound effects and visual feedback
- Improved educational content
- Difficulty levels implementation
- Scoring system

### Phase 3: Polish and Optimization (2-3 weeks)
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility improvements
- Cross-platform testing
- Bug fixes and refinements
- Analytics integration (optional)
- User account system (optional)

## Technology Recommendations

Based on the requirements, the following technology stack is recommended:

### Frontend Framework
- **React** or **Vue.js**: For component-based UI development
- **React Native** or **Flutter**: If mobile app versions are desired

### Styling
- **CSS Modules** or **Styled Components**: For component-specific styling
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-based styling approach

### State Management
- **Redux** or **Context API**: For global state management
- **Local Storage API**: For persistent data

### Build Tools
- **Webpack** or **Vite**: For bundling and development server
- **Babel**: For JavaScript transpilation

### Testing
- **Jest**: For unit and integration testing
- **React Testing Library** or **Vue Testing Utils**: For component testing
- **Cypress**: For end-to-end testing
