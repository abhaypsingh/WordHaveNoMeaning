# Words Without Meaning: System Architecture

## 1. System Overview

"Words Without Meaning" is an educational game that demonstrates how words have no inherent meaning without context. The architecture must support the core educational objectives while providing an engaging, responsive user experience across multiple platforms.

```

## 2. Architectural Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between UI, game logic, educational content, and data management
2. **Modularity**: Components with well-defined interfaces that can be developed and tested independently
3. **Scalability**: Architecture that supports growth in content and user base
4. **Offline-First**: Core functionality available without internet connectivity
5. **Accessibility**: Design that accommodates users with different abilities
6. **Educational Focus**: Architecture decisions prioritize educational effectiveness

## 3. System Components
