# Words Without Meaning: Architecture Summary & Implementation Guidelines

This document provides a concise summary of the architecture for the "Words Without Meaning" game and offers practical guidelines for implementation. It serves as an executive overview of the architectural design and a roadmap for development.

## 1. Architecture Overview

The "Words Without Meaning" game architecture is designed to create an educational experience that demonstrates how words derive meaning from context. The system is organized into five primary layers:

    classDef support fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;
    class GameLogic,Education core;
    class UI,DataAccess,Storage support;
```

### 1.1 Key Architectural Components

1. **User Interface Layer**: Presents the game to users and handles interactions
2. **Game Logic Layer**: Implements core game mechanics and manages game state
3. **Educational Content Layer**: Manages educational aspects and learning progression
4. **Data Access Layer**: Provides unified access to data across the application
5. **Storage Layer**: Handles persistent storage of data

### 1.2 Core Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between UI, game logic, educational content, and data
