3. **Option Generation**
   - **Issue**: Sometimes distractor options are too obviously incorrect
   - **Severity**: Medium
   - **Workaround**: None needed
   - **Planned Fix**: Improve distractor option generation algorithm

### Data Persistence

1. **Session Recovery**
   - **Issue**: Game session may not be properly recovered after browser refresh in some cases
   - **Severity**: Medium
   - **Workaround**: Complete games in a single session
   - **Planned Fix**: Improve session persistence and recovery logic

2. **Storage Limitations**
   - **Issue**: On some browsers, localStorage limits may be reached if many game sessions are stored
   - **Severity**: Low
   - **Workaround**: Clear browser data periodically
   - **Planned Fix**: Implement storage management to remove oldest sessions automatically

### Educational Content

1. **Content Depth**
   - **Issue**: Some linguistic concepts lack sufficient explanation depth
   - **Severity**: Medium
   - **Workaround**: None needed
   - **Planned Fix**: Expand educational content with more detailed explanations

2. **Learning Progression**
   - **Issue**: Learning progression tracking doesn't fully adapt to user's knowledge level
   - **Severity**: Low
   - **Workaround**: None needed
   - **Planned Fix**: Implement more sophisticated learning progression algorithm
