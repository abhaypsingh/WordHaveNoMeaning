# Words Without Meaning: Project Overview

## Project Goal
Create an interactive educational game that demonstrates how words have no inherent meaning without context. The game will challenge users' assumptions about language by presenting words with multiple potential meanings, then revealing how context dramatically changes interpretation.

## Educational Objectives
1. Demonstrate that words are arbitrary symbols whose meanings are determined by context and usage
2. Illustrate how the same word can have contradictory meanings in different contexts
3. Encourage critical thinking about language and communication
4. Provide an engaging, interactive experience that makes linguistic concepts accessible

## Target Audience
- Students (high school and college level)
- Language enthusiasts
- General public interested in linguistics and communication
- Educational institutions

## Core Game Concept
The game presents users with words that have multiple potential meanings. Users select what they believe is the correct definition, then are shown a sentence that uses the word in a completely different context, contradicting their selection. This experience is designed to challenge the notion that words have fixed, inherent meanings.

## Key Features
1. Database of approximately 500 words with multiple potential meanings
2. Multiple-choice interface presenting 4 potential definitions for each word
3. Contextual examples showing how words can be used differently than expected
4. Educational messaging explaining linguistic concepts
5. Progress tracking and scoring system
6. User-friendly interface with intuitive navigation

## Success Criteria
1. Users report increased awareness of how context affects meaning
2. Engagement metrics show users completing multiple rounds of gameplay
3. Educational institutions adopt the game as a teaching tool
4. Positive user feedback regarding the educational value and engagement level

## Project Constraints
1. Must be accessible across multiple platforms (web, mobile)
2. Must function without requiring internet connectivity after initial load
3. Must be suitable for educational environments
4. Must be engaging enough to maintain user interest through multiple rounds
