## Key Interaction Points

1. **Word Selection**: The system must select words that have genuinely different meanings in different contexts to create effective contradictions.

2. **Meaning Options**: The four options must be distinct enough to be clearly different choices, but plausible enough that users can reasonably select any of them.

3. **Contradiction Reveal**: This is the key educational moment and must clearly demonstrate how context changes meaning.

4. **Educational Messaging**: Messages must be concise, engaging, and educational without being pedantic or overly technical.

5. **Progression**: The difficulty curve should increase gradually to maintain engagement without frustrating users.

// TEST: Verify that users can navigate from the launch screen to game setup without confusion
// TEST: Confirm that the contradiction reveal clearly demonstrates the contextual nature of meaning
// TEST: Ensure educational messages are understandable to the target audience
// TEST: Validate that users can complete the entire flow without getting stuck at any point
